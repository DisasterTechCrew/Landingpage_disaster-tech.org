    <h2>About us</h2>
    <p>In the current time, we see once again how vital well operating technology is. It ensures the survival of companies that have to work remotely from now on, that governments and NGOs remain capable of action. Still, above all, it supports the communication of security-relevant information, can help to maintain social contacts of people or to organize volunteer rescue teams.
      <br /><br />
      We are people who, independently of COVID-19, create sustainable technologies to help people and organizations in crisis situations and to ensure that our society can continue to be united. Over 200 people joined our collective ‚Äì designers, developers, scientists, community managers and campaigners, but also lawyers, people from the government sector, scientists and people from disaster relief.
      <br /><br />
      We are facilitating a community based approach to disaster relief with technology. Join us and help us develop tools that help people in crisis situations.</p>
